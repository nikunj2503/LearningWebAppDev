    <h3> 1. What is Web Programming? </h1>
    <p> Web programming refers to the writing, markup and coding involved in Web development, which includes Web content, Web client and server scripting and network security. The most common languages used for Web programming are XML, HTML, JavaScript, Perl 5 and PHP. Web programming is different from just programming, which requires interdisciplinary knowledge on the application area, client and server scripting, and database technology</p>
    <h3> 2. What does Extensible Markup Language mean?</h3>
    <p>Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a universal format maintained by the W3C used for representation and transfer of structured data on the web or between different applications.
    The language uses a structured representation by allowing user to create custom defined tags according to XML Document Type Definition (DTD) standards. The structure of XML document can be represented in the form of a tree known as Document Object Model (DOM).</p>
    <h3>3. What is HTML5</h3>
    <p>Ans. HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. It was finalized, and published, on 28 October 2014 by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). This is the fifth revision of the HTML standard since the inception of the World Wide Web.Over the past few years, you may have heard the term HTML5 every once in a while. Whether you know anything about web development or not, the concept can be somewhat nebulous and confusing. Obviously, it’s the next step in the line of HTML, but what exactly does it do? Why is there so much excitement around it? And why does it matter for you?
    HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the most important element of the World Wide Web. It’s the language used to describe what a webpage should look like. However, HTML on its own is pretty boring because it can only deliver static pages; in order to meet the growing demand for more impressive web features, HTML has been coupled with plugins like CSS, Flash, Java, Silverlight, etc.
